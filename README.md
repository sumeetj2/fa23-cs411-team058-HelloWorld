## Project Summary

CNBC estimates that more than 50% of Americans do not buy flight insurance for their non-refundable flights while traveling anywhere around the world. Missed flights, canceled trips, logistical issues and sudden medical issues are a few situations that could affect flyers and often lead to high costs for alternative transportation or lodging. Common reasons why people avoid purchasing flight insurance are high premiums, or the assumption that it will not be required.

This project aims to tackle this problem by quantifying the need of purchasing travel insurance for a traveller, based on the predicted probability of their flight being delayed or canceled due to various unprecedented reasons. The project utilizes a flight delays dataset to analyse the historical data of flight routes and provide a risk rating for a particular flight, also taking into account the time period. To help travellers gget around the issue of high premium insurance, we also provide them with a personalized list of recommendations of the airlines they should choose to minimize their risk of facing circumstances due to delays and cancellations.
